Abstraction:

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
It focuses on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it.
In object-oriented programming, abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes and methods.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and may contain one or more abstract methods (methods without implementation).
Subclasses of abstract classes must provide implementations for all abstract methods.


Interface:

An interface defines a contract for classes that implement it.
It specifies a set of methods that implementing classes must provide.
Interfaces provide a way for unrelated classes to communicate with each other based on a shared contract.
Methods declared in interfaces are by default abstract (no implementation).
Classes implementing an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods declared in that interface.
